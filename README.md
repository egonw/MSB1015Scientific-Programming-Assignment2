# Overview
This repository contains the second assignment for the Scientific Programming course MSB1015. The assignment is supposed to cover data analysis using R Markdown. More specifically, the assignment is to query (SPARQL) for data on molecules of the chemical class alkanes from wikidata. Retrieved data is processed and a partial least squares regression model is built from the data. With the help of the model, boiling points of the compounds are predicted. Reproducibility of the method pls is assessed using a support vector machine regression.
