# Introduction
The assignment is to query wikidata for information about the chemical class alkanes. Therefore, it is necessary to design a query that will search for alkanes in bespoken database and retrieve data which is needed for further analysis. This information includes boilingpoint, chemical smiles to infer structural information as well as corresponding units and names. 
Subsqequently, the assignment is to build a model that can predict the boilingpoint of a chemical compound based on its chemical composition. In other words the assignment is to derive physical properties from a compounds chemical structure. Therefore, chemical features such as wiener paramters [1] and atom count are used to build a regression model. 
It is assessed how good the model can predict the boilingpoint.

# Methods
## Query
The query on wikidata using the WikidataQueryServiceR [4] package returns all alkanes where the boilingpoint is available in wikidata. It returns the compound identifier, compound label, boilingpoint, boilingpoint unit as well as the boilingpoint unit label. 
All units are converted into kelvin because it is the SI unit. The result is inspected with respect to it's completeness and correctness of boilingpoints. Two boilingpoints were detected to have and comma instead of a point. Therefore, the two compounds had unreasonably high boilingpoints. After correcting for the mistake in wikidata, the data was found to be correct. 
```{r query}


# 1. Query for Alkanes in wikidata: get boilingpoint with units and smiles for each molecule
query <- 'SELECT DISTINCT ?comp ?compLabel ?bp ?bpUnit ?bpUnitLabel ?CC WHERE {   
          ?comp wdt:P31/wdt:P279* wd:Q41581 ;   
          wdt:P233 ?CC ;     
          p:P2102 [         ps:P2102 ?bp ;           
          psv:P2102/wikibase:quantityUnit  ?bpUnit         ] .   
          SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". } } '
# Results of query as well as results after unit conversion are stored in r
r <- query_wikidata(query)
r <- Unit_conversion_to_Kelvin(r)
```
``` {r metrics, echo=FALSE}
print(paste("Mean boilingpoint:", round(mean(r$bp)),"K"))
print(paste("Lowest boilingpoint:", round(min(r$bp)),"K"))
print(paste("Highest boilingpoint:", round(max(r$bp)),"K"))
```
## Descriptors
The R package rcdk [2] was used to compute chemical compound descriptors based on smiles. As descriptors Wiener numbers [1], apolarity and atom count were chosen as descriptors. However the number of descriptors as well as the type of descriptors will be subject to change for future users. 
```{r descriptors}
# 2. Parse smiles and compute descriptors
# Selection of suitable selectors is crucial to be able to predict the boiling point of chemical
# compound with reasonable accuracy. The function get.desc.names() will print a list of descriptors
# available within the rcdk package. The user of this code may chose any set of descriptors that is
# considered to contain information relevant to predicting the boiling point. Adding it to the list
# of descriptor names will allow for computation of descriptors from the smiles. 
descNames <- c(
  'org.openscience.cdk.qsar.descriptors.molecular.WienerNumbersDescriptor',
  'org.openscience.cdk.qsar.descriptors.molecular.APolDescriptor',
  'org.openscience.cdk.qsar.descriptors.molecular.AtomCountDescriptor',
  'org.openscience.cdk.qsar.descriptors.molecular.MDEDescriptor'
  )
descs <- computeDescriptors(r, descNames)
descs <- removeConstantDesc(descs)
descs <- descs[, - 14] 


```
Partial least squares regression (pls) [3] was chosen to perform regression from descriptors to boilingpoint. The dataset is split into training and testing dataset after randomization. pls regression is performed with crossvalidation. Root mean squared error of prediction and correlation of prediction with true results is chosen to assess the performance of the regression model. It is also being compared with the null model which is taking the average of all boilingpoints in the training set to predict the test set. 

Additionally, a support vector machine regression is performed in order to assess reproducibility of the results using a different method. 

# Results
When taking the four descriptors that are set by default, the RMSEP on the training set indicates that using two principle components will predict boilingpoints on the testset with reasonable accuracy. Plots and numbers report on the performance of the model. 
```{r pls regression}
# 3. Perform pls regression 

# 3.1 split dataset into training and testing datasets
# Randomization has great influence on how the model is built (trainingset) and how it performs on 
# the testset. Because the dataset is fairly small the way in which randomization occurs (set.seed())
# is esential fro reproducibility of results. It is important to keep in mind that a different seed 
# might produce different results. 
data <- data.frame(r$bp, descs)
set.seed(42)
rows <- sample(nrow(data))
data <- data[rows, ]
split <- round(nrow(data)*0.7)

train <- data[1:split, ]
test <- data[(split+1):nrow(data), ]
ytrain <- train$r.bp
ytest <- test$r.bp
```

```  {r report, echo =FALSE}
# report sizes of train and test 
print(paste("Number of samples in trainingset: ", nrow(train)))
print(paste("Number of samples in testset: ", nrow(test)))
```

``` {r model}
# 3.2 Build null model as the mean of all boilingpoints 
nullmodel <- mean(train$r.bp)
errorNM <- rmse(test$r.bp, nullmodel)

# 3.3 Train pls regression model
mdl <- plsr(train$r.bp ~., data = train, validation = "CV")
error <- RMSEP(mdl, estimate = "CV") # <- select two principle components
predicted <- predict(mdl, test)
error.pred <- rmse(predicted, ytest)
#plot(mdl$residuals)
## Visualization
# plot predicted against actual values
plot(predicted[,,1], ytest, xlab = "Predicted Boiling Point [K]", ylab = "Measured Boiling Point [K]", main = "Regression with one PC")
plot(predicted[,,2], ytest, xlab = "Predicted Boiling Point [K]", ylab = "Measured Boiling Point [K]", main = "Regression with two PCs")
plot(predicted[,,3], ytest, xlab = "Predicted Boiling Point [K]", ylab = "Measured Boiling Point [K]", main = "Regression with three PCs")
plot(predicted[,,4], ytest, xlab = "Predicted Boiling Point [K]", ylab = "Measured Boiling Point [K]", main = "Regression with four PCs")

# plot error
# first error is the error of the null model and does not use any principle component from the pca.
# Thus it will be excluded from this plot. 
plot(error$val[,,2:ncol(data)], type = "l", pch = 16,  xlab = "Number of principle components",
     ylab = "RMSEP [K]", main = "RMSE of Prediction against Number of Principle Components")
print(paste("Error of the nullmodel:", round(mean(error$val[,,1])),"K"))
# correlation of results 
corr <- c()
for (i in 1:ncol(data)-1) {
  corr[i] <- cor(predicted[,,i], ytest)
}
plot(corr, type = "p", xlab = "Number of principle components", ylab = "Correlation",
     main = "Correlation of Prediction against Number of Principle Components")
library(e1071)
library(Metrics)
svm <- svm(train$r.bp ~., data = train)
svm.pred <- predict(svm, test)
error.svm <- rmse(svm.pred, ytest)
